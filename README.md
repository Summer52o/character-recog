# character-recog
Very Old Project Files. Pardon me for these files are very haphazardly managed. I was a kid back then. :P

It contains MATLAB files for character recognition. Several Methods are tried in here-
1. Hu's invariant Moments,
2.Freeman's Chain Code,
3. Crude Machine Learning.

I will clean up when I'll find time..
